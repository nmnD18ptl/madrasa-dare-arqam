# Logo Setup Instructions

## Adding the Logo

To add the Jamia Dar-E-Arqam logo to the website:

1. **Place the logo file** in the `public/` folder
   - Name it: `logo.png`
   - Recommended format: PNG with transparent background
   - Recommended size: At least 200x200px for high-resolution displays

2. **Logo Display**
   - The logo will automatically appear in the header/navigation
   - It's already integrated in `src/components/Header.tsx`
   - If the logo doesn't load, the text "JAMIA DAR-E-ARQAM" will be shown as a fallback

3. **Logo Specifications**
   - Format: PNG (preferred) or SVG
   - Background: Transparent (recommended)
   - Dimensions: Minimum 200x200px
   - Maximum file size: 500KB (for fast loading)
